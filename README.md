# GIS Analysis - Bank Branch Management
Course: GIS Application | UW-Madison<br>
Instructor: A-Xing Zhu<br>
Teaching Assistant: Yuying Chen<br>
Software: QGIS<br>

## Description
This project is a task in a GIS analysis course that involves mapping the current situation of bank branches and examining the correlation between customer demographic trends and branch performance. Ultimately, we need to provide recommendations on whether to close existing branches or open new ones based on the analysis results. The location of this task was set at the Metro area in Toronto, Canada.<br>
In this project, our objectives are to identify the problem, develop a comprehensive project plan (including variable identification and data requirements), and execute the plan accordingly. For more information about the questions and my answers, please check out the <a href='https://github.com/KCivilEnGI/GISAnalysis_BankBranches/blob/main/KuangChengCheng_Lab4.pdf'>project report</a> in this repository.
